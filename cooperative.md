### East Asia Biodiversity Conservation Network
East Asia Biodiversity Conservation Network (EABCN) is a regional network committed to implementing Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (GSPC) through international cooperation and establishing a platform to conserve biodiversity at the regional level in East Asia.The EABCN is established by a Motion, WCC-2012-RES-034: Strengthening training and capacities for botanical gardens and arboreta staff for the Global Strategy of Plant Conservation (GSPC) 2020 in East Asia, which is proposed by Korea Forest Service(KFS) and adopted at the 5th IUCN World Conservation Congress held in Jeju, Republic of Korea, in 2012. The EABCN will provide a variety of biological information data collected from the East Asia region including the DMZ in order to enable users to access and utilize the data for global biological research, ecological conservation and policy making.

### DMZ Botanic Garden
The DMZ Botanic Garden is a branch of the Korea National Arboretum established in Mandae-ri, Haean-myeon, Gangwon-do. The DMZ Botanic Garden is created to collect and conserve various plant resources of the DMZ, particularly in the northern region, to conduct research on restoration of the forest ecosystem in North Korea after unification, and to conserve rare and endemic plants in the DMZ region that connects the east-west ecological axis. Envisioning the center of research on northern plants and forest ecosystems on the Korean Peninsula, the DMZ Botanic Garden establishes a foundation to collect northern plant resources and carry out research on forest ecosystem, to restore and conserve degraded forests in the DMZ & CCA area in the eastern region, and to revitalize the local economy through ex-situ conservation of rare, endemic, and endangered species of northern plants as well as proliferation and utilization technology development of useful plant resources. As an hub for northern forest biodiversity and international research on forest ecological environment, it aims to create an ecological botanic garden that can collect, conserve and commercialize plant resource as well as predict changes in forest ecosystems.

### Korea National Arboretum (Korea Forest Service)
The Korea National Arboretum provides forest environmental education in terms of research, collection, classification and conservation of Korean forest biospecies. We are also committed to conservation along with restoration of rare and native plants, promotion of useful plant resources research as well as related technology development, designing and management of thematic gardens, forest bio species and forest culture. In particular, the KNA is one of the renowned forest biospecies research centers which was an affiliate of the Central Region Experimental Forestry Station of the Forestry Research Center until its establishment on 24th May 1999. The Arboretum was founded in an attempt to promote the conservation of Gwangneung forest underpinned by the government measures in 1997.

### Institute of the biological problems of the North FEB RAS
Institute of Biological Problems of the North FEB RAS was founded on February 1, 1972. Over the vast territory of the Far-Eastern North of Russia, IBPN FEB RAS is the only academic institution, which has been carrying out fundamental investigations on different problems of contemporary biology. Today the Institute conducts investigations, defined by the three basic trends: study of functioning, organization principles and adaptive strategies of the northern populations, communities and ecosystems; study of biological diversity on the territory of the North-East of Asia; development of scientific principles of conservation, reproduction and rational use of biological resources of the North. Herbarium of IBPN FEB RAS was found in 1970; it consists of collection of vascular plants, fungi, lichens and muscoids. International index of herbarium is MAG (assigned in 1997). Herbarium of vascular plants includes collections from 1970 to present time, and earlier samples (of 1940-1960), obtained from land survey expedition, and has being constantly completed by new samples. Over 1700 species of vascular plants are represented in herbarium. Total number of sheets is over 110000. The most part of the collection is represented by samples from Magadan region and adjoining territories – Primorye, Kamchatka, Chukotka, Commander Islands and others. Vascular plants are arranged according to Engler system, genera are given numbers by Dalla Torre, inside genera – in alphabetical order. Besides, geographical principle of distribution is observed. Electronic catalogue of herbarium labels is presented for several families and genera. Since 2006 new collections of plants have been added to catalog. Collection of seeds and fruits numbers over 3600 specimens, representing over 2000 species of plants from Siberia and the Far East. Mycological herbarium contains over 10000 specimens of over 700 species of fungi-macromycete. Herbarium of lichens includes over 4700 specimens of about 270 species. Herbarium of muscoids numbers about 4400 specimens of 390 species of mosses and liverworts.
