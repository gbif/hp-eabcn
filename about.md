## Background

* The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report(2007) alarmed on the increasing level of climate change and its impact to the environmental degradation in the future: The average world temperature rose 0.76 ℃ from 1850 to 2005; the average temperature will rise 1.4-5.8 ℃ more by 2100; the grassland will become desert; the forest will be destroyed; and in 50 years from then over 1/3 of the earth plants and animals will be extinct or will be endangered.

* The degree of climate change in East Asia is in much more serious level than the world average level, estimated to be increased of average temperature to 3.5 ℃ and of the rainfall amount to 4.5%, which urgently calls the cooperation within the countries to diminish it.

* The East Asia is the area where many plant species are commonly distributed including rare and endemic plant species.

* It is necessary to establish the East Asia Biodiversity Conservation Network to provide the basis for promoting conservation and sustainable use of forest plant resources.

## EABCN joint research topics

* Research on the monitoring of species distribution by climate change

* Development of East Asia Integrated flora (Check list)

* Monitoring on exotic plants and building data sharing platform

* Strengthening the research capacity and human resources
